== RescueCMS

RescueCMS is not a general content management system. It aims to be a turn key management system for anyone involved in animal rescue. The goal is to create a management system that encompasses the day to day operations of the rescue of animals. This could be anything from a single individual who runs a foster to a loose group of people in a neighborhood that network to rescue animals or a shelter or humane society.

Things you can do with RescueCMS:

* Track animals in your care through the entire rescue lifecycle

* Keep a history ( behavior, health, ownership, foster ) from entry to exit to promote successful adoptions

* View reports to answer common questions and evaluate performance of your organization

* Configure animal properties, locations, and more

* Integrate with a front end website out of the box

* Share what you do through Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest

* Help your animals find their forever home through existing networks such as Petfinder
