## RescueServe

RescueServe is not a general content management system. It aims to be a turn key management system for anyone involved in animal rescue. The goal is to create a management system that encompasses the day to day operations of rescuing animals. This could be anything from a single individual who runs a foster to a loose group of people in a neighborhood that network to rescue animals or a shelter or humane society.
