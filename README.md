## RescueServe

RescueServe is a management system for animal rescue organizations. The goal is to create a management system that encompasses the day to day operations of rescuing animals and provides a simple, integrated front end. This could be anything from a single individual who runs a foster to a loose group of people in a neighborhood that network to rescue animals or a shelter or humane society.
